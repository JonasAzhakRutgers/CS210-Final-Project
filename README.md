We created a data management project aiming to provide a data based approach on predicting outcomes of a legal case based on lawyer demographics. This project
was done by making a csv file of data collected from these demographics,and the lawyers likelihood of winning a future case based on them. In this branch we have multiple
files, including a Data Simulation,Explanatory Data Analysis(EDA), a Logistic Regression Model, and a chart of data founnd(csv).

Data Simulation: This file provides the initial code used to create our data. It shows the 200 lawyers we simulated, the coefficients we chose, and how we implemented them 
into a dataframe. It also shows the output of the scores they recieved from 0-100 based on how likely they are to wina  future case. 

Chart of Data(csv): This organized chart of data isolates the 200 lawyers places in the three coefficients, and there probability scores regarding these coefficients. 

Exploratory Data Analysis(in PDF and .ipynb format): This file includes code and data found from using visualization techniques and statistical tools to support our hypothesis 
and manage our data into graphs. The graphs shown in this file are valuable examples of our data in different formats, and how each coefficient plays a role in a case.

Logistic Regression Model(in PDF and .ipynb format): This file includes code and data used to create a logistic regression model. Mathematical calculations and use of different
Python libraries were created to simulate the model. The file shows three different graphs from this simulation, including a histogram, a scatter plot, and a sigmoid curve.
